APPROVED,Bad Quality and Slow Shipping,"I waited like 10 days after they shipped, also my headband are not the ones they have to make after I order them. It took them too long to ship my headbands.

The only good thing was the design was pretty cool",2,2015-11-20 04:00:00 UTC,email,1645465284,rachel19kk@gmail.com,"Hi Rachel,

We are so sorry you have not had a great experience-- let&#x27;s see what we can do to make it better! In regards to the headband slipping, JUNK headbands are a bit different than other brands in that they are designed to wear on the hairline so they won&#x27;t slip. Have you checked out our &quot;How to Wear&quot; Videos? http://www.junkbrands.com/pages/how-to-wear

In regards to the product damage-- we would be happy to make it right and exchange any defective headband if you could email us info@junkbrands.com

Thanks so much for your feedback! We are working to improve our order fulfillment and shipping processes so JUNK lovers get their gear on time. 

thanks so much!",1,140,Not Disclosed

APPROVED,"Great style, different size?","I love Big Bang Lite bands. These are mainly the only kind I buy to workout in the gym. Admittedly I have a bigger head but I've never had an issue throwing the headband around my neck and pulling it up over my head. For some reason, this Northern Lights feels a little less stretchy on the ends. The inside is stretchy but the exterior stitching (maybe) is a little more rigid. I have to play with it a little bit to get it on but it stays once it is there!

APPROVED,Pour on the Junk!,"I have long, fly away hair that doesn't mix well with the south Florida heat and humidity that I live in. Combine that with CrossFit or running and it can be quite a sight! It was because of this that I become an addict of headbands.

I love that there are a billion prints and colors to mix it up and the different styles are great! They don't slip so long as you wear them right, and they hold up well over multiple washes. Some of mine are over a year and half -2 years old and still look great!

We tried using the standard fuzzy cotton headbands before, but he always complained that they were too tight or actually made his head hot while wearing them.

APPROVED,Sweat Yeah,"I am a tall athletic male with longer hair that sweats a ton, probably more than i should actually. Well I was getting tired of using towel after towel to wipe my forehead so I could see when I workout and not trip over weights and smaller people. So the adventure began looking for a headband that wasn't from the 80's nor to feminine (nothing wrong with it but not my style). After months and months of exhaustive research I found JUNK and fell in love with the brand. I have two now and really love how they fit and feel without me looking too girlie.

APPROVED,FLIPPIN' AMAZING!!,"Ok, my head… it’s pretty big (for a chick), and it’s even kind of… let’s say oddly shaped. Headbands for workouts never work for me (partially because I don’t have enough area in the back to really hold them in place) and they always slip back after like one movement, if that! I’ve tried all the “non slip grip” ones… fail!! They slip. These headbands are super soft, super comfy, you can scrunch to make a little thinner or keep them wider and they STAY IN PLACE THE WHOLE WORKOUT!!! Without any grippy stuff at that!! Yeeee!! Winning!! I don’t usually rate or review things, but will if I believe in the product that much. This I believe in 10000%. (I use the Big Bang Light/lite).",5,2016-02-14 04:00:00 UTC,email,yotpo_site_reviews,karinarain.d@gmail.com,"Hey there Karina! We are so thankful that you wrote us a review!

APPROVED,Only headbands I buy!,I originally discovered JUNK bands on Reebok when I bought a cute Christmas headband. I was amazed at how comfortable it was and how much it soaked up my sweaty head! Unfortunately I swear a lot from my head and it gets right into my eyes. I wear the Big Bang Lites and it has prevented the sweat from getting in my eyes. It's especially important when I teach my fitness class bc with a mic on I can't keep wiping sweat off my face. They have so many cool designs and I especially like all of the animal ones. I usually rinse them out with a little hand soap or sometimes put them right in with my workout clothing inside a lingerie bag. I love JUNK bands and I'll be wearing these forever!

APPROVED,"Great Headband, Loose Fit","I love Junk Brands headbands, I currently own three of them and purchased one for my dad last year. The Big Bang Lite was a new style I wanted to try, and I love the Candy Crush pattern, so I was excited. I noticed its a bit loose on me, and I would recommend that Junk make different sizes in this particular style so everyone can potentially wear one. It slides off my head a lot, which isn;t good when I'm working out, so I tend to use my other Junk headbands for more physical activities and use my BBL when I'm out and about running errands and such. I really love this product and wish it worked for me 100% but I understand that sometimes that's the risk you take buying a OSFM.",4,2016-02-28 04:00:00 UTC,web,4151320708,musicon1110@hotmail.com,"Hey there Meg, we are happy that you love our headbands!

Under a helmet on a motorcycle Junk Bands fit great and give you a little extra warmth. Wherever I go friends and family have commented on how great the Junk Bands look.

APPROVED,Great,"I ordered two of the flex tie headbands, as much as it should have been a five star review, it wasnt becasue one of the headbands had a minor tear, nothing extreme or noticeable by the naked eye, but its worth stating if you are picky. I am not one of those people so i didn't care much for it. They were perfect to wick the sweat and they were super comfortable and since i have long hair, I used it to keep my hair out of my face mainly while keeping it free flowing and it worked perfectly for that. I will only buy headbands from junk from now on because I was left with a very pleasant experience.",4,2016-04-23 04:00:00 UTC,email,4361639620,therobbyevans@gmail.com,"Hey there Robby!

APPROVED,"Does the job, could use upgrades","The bands are doing the job of keeping my hair out of my eyes, but I'd like something with a big heavier material to stay in place in aggressive training and contain excess sweat. After 15 min of real training I'm still using my shirt to rub sweat out of my eyes. 
It's a good product, I'd just prefer a more robust option, I'd even pay a premium for such a product.

APPROVED,Didn't know what I was missing!,I recently started CrossFit and I sweat like a banshee. I saw an ad on Facebook for the Junk brand headbands so I started looking into them and purchased a couple. It's been the best investment. It keeps the sweat from dripping off my head and into my face while I'm working out. It also keeps my hair in place since some of it is too short to put back in a ponytail. I like that they're lightweight and snug enough to stay put no matter what workout I'm doing.,5,2016-04-25 04:00:00 UTC,email,yotpo_site_reviews,fajahara1@yahoo.com,"Hey there Farrah!

APPROVED,exactly what I was looking for!,I've always used the small sport hair bands mostly to keep the hair out of my face but they would never stay put. I was in need of something better. I also recently cut off about 15 inches of hair and ponytails aren't really a thing anymore. With these JUNK headbands I don't have to worry about them slipping off my head or hair flying in my face. They wick/soak up just enough sweat also.

You can actually return them, if you are not satisfied you can definitely return them for a full refund! Just email us back and we will get you taken care of! Also, the headbands that do tie in the back are what you need! We highly encourage you to try the ties, also it&#x27;s very important to wear your headband on your forehead (skin)! It&#x27;s a sweat-wicking headband so we designed these headbands to fit perfectly around your forehead! We promise that these headbands stay on! I would try wearing it on your forehead, if you still aren&#x27;t satisfied we suggest trying the tie. This works better for some! Hope to hear from you soon :)

APPROVED,Junk Shrinkage!! YIKES!,"First let me start by saying I absolutely love the quality of the fabric these are made of. I bought my first Junk Flex Fit headbands at the CrossFit Regionals in San Antonio three years ago. This is the third straight year I've visited the Junk booth at Regionals to stock up on more Junk. I am disappointed that my Junk keeps shrinking. I noticed the ones I bought last year seemed a littler smaller than the ones I bought the year before. This year the newer headbands are not as wide as they used to be by almost a 1/2"". I understand needing to cut costs, but if they don't get wider again I'm going to look elsewhere when I need to buy more headbands.",1,2016-05-29 04:00:00 UTC,email,4317297476,jacobw99@yahoo.com,"Hi Jacob, we&#x27;re sorry the narrower width isn&#x27;t working for you. We are constantly working to improve the headbands and have narrowed our flex tie offering down to that 2.5 inch width. Have you ever thought about trying a Big Bang Lite?

APPROVED,Better Than Halo,"I love these headbands. I switched from Halo to Junk. These are lighter and more comfortable. And like Halo, sweat never stings my eyes. 
 
I wear them for racquetball where the various soft serves are called “junk” serves. 
 
I bought a Never Forgotten headband for a friend who was in the military. You claimed it would be a limited edition Memorial Day release. I’m disappointed that you’re still selling it. Now it’s no longer as special. 
 
You selection has plain colors on one end and very complex designs on the other. There’s not much in between. I like the busier designs but they’re too out-of-place at my racquetball club. 
 
Look to the designs of tennis shirts and shorts. Most are have simple lines.

APPROVED,Simply the Best on and off the job.,"As a whole, I love the products. They stay in place without sliding around or becoming ruffled up. The bands work very well under a fire helmet and work well to keep sweat out of my eyes. Being that I balded young and now shave my head, I purchased my first JUNK band simply to keep sweat from my eyes. The band works well in this capacity. After the initial purchase of two from my CrossFit gym, I ordered three more from the website. The JUNK bands hold a surprising amount of sweat and even then will keep the sweat from your eyes. They dry quickly, and can be machine washed with your clothes without issue. I have put the bands to the test with workouts in the Texas Sun, drilling at my fire station, and under my fire helmet on calls. As for the style, I love the variety that JUNK offers. Obviously being a rookie firefighter the Rescue band is my go-to band for workouts and on the job. Its a small thing but I appreciate the company making it possible for me (and I imagine others) to show solidarity with law enforcement and the military in a small way. I would love to see an EMS headband as well, though to represent Fire, Police, EMS, and Military across the board. The bands are a conversation starter for sure at work, so its pretty cool to rep the company and different branches of the public safety family on the job. I highly recommend any of the JUNK bands, no questions asked, 5/5.",5,2016-07-09 04:00:00 UTC,web,2604357316,bkprill@gmail.com,"Wow, Brandon, thank you so much for this thoughtful review!

APPROVED,Unlucky customer,"I'm a new customers to the Junk company. I got informed by my gym friends about Junk headbands. They said how great customer service is and how good quality the headbands are, so I signed up. I ordered 3 headbands white, grey, and black. I was excited to get them, but I had to wait a few more extra days because of 4th of July weekend. I got them 2 days later. I opened the bag and I immediately tried them on. I come to find out that my white headband was dirty and my grey headband had a little hole on it. I did notice the hole until a tried it on, since headband material is stretchable, that's when I noticed the hole. You can't tell there's a hole on it, until the headband is stretched on your head. I called customer service, but the guy said its not the company's problem because the bag wasn't ripped or destroyed during the shipment. I'm really thinking if I should continue to buy products from this company or not. I guess I wasn't the lucky customer that day. In the mean time, I'll keep on using my only one which is the black headband.",2,2016-07-11 04:00:00 UTC,email,yotpo_site_reviews,fernie2435@gmail.com,"Hi Fernando, we are so sorry for the poor experience you&#x27;ve had!

I have a big head (both literally and metaphorically) so when I first received the hat I was worried when even at the second to largest setting it was still a little snug.

I checked with a store in Orlando during a recent trip there, and they didn't carry them. I also checked with our local store in Savannah, Georgia, and they don't carry them. Dick's is building a store here in Hinesville, Georgia, and I hope they carry them.

REJECTED,Aggrivating and Borderline Insulting,"Online accessibility was fine and organized, I'll give you that. Response time for customer service was okay. Everything else was pretty bad. 
 
In my specific case, I ordered a headband on a Tuesday with priority shipping to arrive on Thursday or Friday. It arrived the followed Monday. I needed it for the weekend and I paid extra for it to arrive for the weekend. Tracking online wasn't showing me anything. You guys have 0 communication over the weekend as all operations seem to cease. No emails returned and calls didn't exist on the weekend with you guys. Then, when I emailed about my situation after I received my headband, I felt like you guys were following terrible, immoral business protocol (I would know I'm in the business world, I am a business owner) and just trying to act stupid about the situation to keep your profit. It's an old trick of the book I know. My headband came late, I complained, and all I got was ""uh well the post office messed up."" HOW IS THAT APPROPRIATE or supposed to satisfy me? At least give the customer the run around and try to make it seem like you guys are working on it. This annoyed me as this was not enough resolution. I wanted my money back and It was severely unclear if I was going to get compensated for the extra shipping that I had paid. I had to make it clear again to give me my entire money back as if nothing ever happened. 
People don't like to be played for a fool, put some more care into your protocol for your customer service. Give options and have some morals to actually care about the customer. Have the ability to sniff out the bullshit from the real, not make an extra dollar off everyone and everything. Karma is huge in the world of business. Instant gratification will blind a business. 
 
Also, I received en email to rate my experience and after a few days of getting to that email, the request was timed out!! Seriously it's the little things that count. Oh and the headband was a little small and the video didn't do the size justice. 
 
How about that for a review? Print it and put it on the wall boys and girls.",1,2016-07-29 04:00:00 UTC,email,yotpo_site_reviews,etanahan@gmail.com,,,2311,Not Disclosed

APPROVED,First time Junk buyer...and it's worth it!,"I was a little hesistant about the pricetag, but I've tried a lot of headbands (read: wasted a lot of money) and they either were too tight (and pulled hair out), too loose and didn't stay in place, made me even hotter and sweatier, or a combination of these. This headband is GREAT!! I've worn it for 3 WODs now, and it doesn't move at all, it doesn't make me hotter when working out, and I haven't had to wipe my face with my shirt mid-WOD once. I normally like headbands a little thinner, but I folded the BBL a bit, and it was perfect...it didn't bunch up or slide around or anything. And the pattern and colors are AWESOME! I've already gotten several compliments on it. This headband would be perfect for anything from everyday use (aka not wanting to do anything to your hair) to yoga to Crossfit. Next time, I'm buying 2 headbands (I wish I had done that the first time)! You ROCK, JUNK Brands!!",5,2016-08-12 04:00:00 UTC,web,4361693636,catherine.nicholson@gmail.com,Wow-- best review ever!

APPROVED,Review for Jess O'toole,"Jess made my experience with buying from Junk, honestly, unforgettable. To this day, she has been the best customer service rep I have ever dealt with at any company and I am so thankful for her help during my purchase. I was flip-flopping between buying a headband or not for a music festival I was going to. 3 days before I finally decided to pull the trigger but feared that my purchase wouldn't ship in time, so I called your customer service line to see what their thoughts were on it, and if they thought there was a possibility of it making it on time. I spoke with Jess on the phone for about 10 minutes and she promised that if I e-mailed her right after ordering it, that she would process the order immediately and make sure it would ship that day. I did exactly that, and got a reply within minutes from Jess saying that the package had been sent out to shipping! This was so amazing, and I couldn't believe the amount of attention and care Jess put towards my purchase. I tracked the package in the coming days and was beyond stoked when I got a text message saying the package arrived at my apartment on the Friday before we left for the festival. I rushed home because I couldn't wait to check it out. After opening the package, I realized that Jess did even more for me with regards to my purchase which absolutely blew me away. I had a hand written note from Jess herself thanking me for my purchase and wishing me the best of time at the festival. She also threw in a awesome ""Junk"" sticker and a pair of ""Junk"" brand sun glasses! Literally the weekend before I lost my sunglasses at the beach and this was seriously incredible of her to do that. I have never dealt with someone so awesome, so nice, and so attentive than Jess. I can sit here and write a billion words about her and it still wouldn't do her justice. I've worked in Hospitality & service my entire life and I can truly say that Jess is one of the, if not THE best customer service rep I have ever come across. If my word means anything, please do anything and everything to keep Jess at that company because she is phenomenal in every sense of the word. And Jess, if you get to read this, please let me know if there is anyway I can ever re-pay this incredible act of kindness! You rock and because of you I will 100% be purchasing from Junk again, and will without a doubt be referring all my friends and family. Keep killing it Jess! and THANK YOU!!!",5,2016-08-15 04:00:00 UTC,email,yotpo_site_reviews,gregory.thomas@starwoodhotels.com,"Hey there Gregory!!

REJECTED,I adore Junk bands!,I have over 20 Junk bands now and I seriously love them. Nothing keeps the sweat out of my eyes like these bands. I love the Big Bang Lite and especially love the funkier designs like Grafitti and Brainwash. I have turned on about 3 or 4 of my friends to them as well. I think what I love most is the technical fabric they make these with. It's very absorbent and soft but also washes up very well. I wash mine in a laundry bag with Sport detergent and lay or hang to dry. They are holding up wonderfully!,5,2016-08-25 04:00:00 UTC,email,yotpo_site_reviews,colleen_co@yahoo.com,,,2552,Not Disclosed

I can say with accuracy after 60+ miles of running in 100+ degree heat in Florida, this headband has not stretched or slipped in the slightest and does not drip when soaked (After 16miles in the heat I wrung it out and there was a pool of sweat 12""x12"" and it never once dripped on me while wearing it).

APPROVED,Awesome Product,"I am a coach and personal trainer. Lately I have witnessed multiple clients wearing JUNK brand headbands. Out of curiosity, I asked a few people about it. They said they loved it because it kept the sweat out of their eyes and kept them cooler (we live in the desert and have been exercising in 110+ degrees). Still somewhat skeptical, I decided to order one and try it out. I don't know how I survived WODs without it! No more stopping mid-workout to wipe the sweat from my face. I realized the cooling effect immediately after taking the headband off; it felt like a wave of hot air hit my forehead. After putting away my equipment, I picked up the headband to put it away and it was noticeably cool to the touch. Significantly cooler than the ambient temperature! I was shocked to say the least. Try it out; after a workout, take it of for a couple minutes then feel it. I have worn this in every WOD for the past week and I plan on ordering a couple extra.",5,2016-09-02 04:00:00 UTC,email,2604175172,jmhohman2007@gmail.com,"Jeffery, we love to hear feedback!

APPROVED,Best headband I've owned,Ive always used bandanas in the past and they do a pretty good job except I have to roll them up and then they get bulky and uncomfortable after a while. You see I sweat a ton. It only takes walking up a flight of stairs or too warm of a temperature and I start to sweat from my head. These headbands are great! they are light and super comfortable. They keep you cool because they are thin enough to wick the moisture off but still keep absorbing the sweat. I was able to take it past it's breaking point but it took a lot of hard work. These stay in the same place the whole time. No need to move them and adjust them just place it and forget it.

APPROVED,I love this Junk too!,"I actually just got back from Crossfit and wore this headband. As per my last review; Junk headbands really are awesome. If you're like me and shopped around - EVERYWHERE (Dicks, Amazon, even Etsy to name a few) - I couldn't find anything that really appealed to me, especially for the average price. Then I found Junk. They're not only incredibly functional and comfortable, but they look awesome in person. I have three different ones now, and they're all great. 

One thing to mention is the free shipping offered for $32+. Most of the headbands cost $15.99, and thus two of them total $31.98. I decided to call their customer service to ask if they could still offer me the free shipping, and the person I spoke with said that they couldn't do anything to help. I decided to order the two headbands anyway, but actually ended-up getting the free shipping. So not sure what the deal is there, but figured it was worth mentioning.",5,2016-10-04 04:00:00 UTC,email,4907712324,etg1220@protonmail.com,"Hi Ello, thanks so much for taking time to leave a review.
